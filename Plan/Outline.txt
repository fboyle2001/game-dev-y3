Plan for coursework:
Story guidance:
- Assassin kitten video:
    - Deployable cat character as well as the main character
    - Cat is attached to or follows the player
- Tree growing video:
    - Could have a level or quest where you need to defend the tree while it grows
    - Protect it from enemies
- Phantom of the opera video:
    - Could have part of the story require travel in a boat underground
    
Story plan:
- First stage is retrieving the seeds
- Second stage is defending the tree as it grows
- Third stage is delivering them by boat to an underground location

Mechanics:
- Could have some sort of time slowdown using an empty GO that is fetched in the Start()
  then multiply speeds or something. Probably too much.
- Deployable cat assassin
- Potentially add some puzzle elements, using the fact we have two characters?
- Holes that the cat can go through but not the player
- Power ups
- Upgrades:
    - Upgrade player and cat
    - Starter kits
- Difficulty:
    - Affects how effective enemy AI is
    - Number of enemies
    - Time to defend objectives increased
    - Lower health
    - Less stamina
    - Luck for drops
- Enemies
- Boss fight
    - With unique mechanics perhaps learnt across the level

Other:
- Could do some cool stuff with lighting
- Quests

To-do:
- Inventory screen
- Vendor
- Enemy pathing
- Floating orbs
- Upgrades
